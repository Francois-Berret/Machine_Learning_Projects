This set of projects was carried out with the aim of validating the “Machine Learning” block of the RNCP “Designer-Developer in data science” level 7 certification.

This folder contains three distinct machine learning projects. 
The first one involves predicting the sales of various Walmart stores using a supervised machine learning model, based on store-specific data such as regional unemployment rate, gas price during the considered period, outdoor temperature, and more. 
The second project follows a Kaggle competition format and focuses on building a supervised machine learning model with the highest F1-score to predict whether visitors to the website www.datascienceweekly.org will subscribe to the associated newsletter. Additionally, recommendations are proposed to enhance user conversion rates for the newsletter. 
The third project entails an unsupervised machine learning model aimed at identifying 'hot-zones' of user queries for Uber on a map, with the goal of optimizing driver locations during specific time periods.
